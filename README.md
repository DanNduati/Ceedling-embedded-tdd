    <h1><b> Ceedling Unit Tests </b></h1>
</center>

## <b>Description</b>
Here's another ceedling TDD project and you are probably wondering why well this is me rethinking my previous TDD approach: writing tests for an application that you are already working on which turned out to be really difficult. So on this project ill be starting out with a small test project
### Cycle
1. Write a test, and watch it fail.
2. Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor.
4. Repeat.
## <b>Prerequisites</b>
- [Ceedling](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling)

## <b>Creating a new ceedling project</b>
Use the `ceedling new <projectName>` command to create a new project:
```bash
$ ceedling new rethink
```
This generates:
- `src` : Where all of the source files will go.
- `build` :  Contains anything generated by Ceedling during the build.
- `test` : Where our unit test files will go.

## <b>Creating a module</b>
```bash
$ ceedling module:create[lights]
File src/lights.c created
File src/lights.h created
File test/test_lights.c created
Generate Complete
```
This creates three files: lights.c to implement our module, lights.h to define the public APIs and a test file where unit tests for the module are created.
