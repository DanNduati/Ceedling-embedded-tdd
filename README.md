## <b>Description</b>
Here's another ceedling TDD project and you are probably wondering why well this is me rethinking my previous TDD approach: writing tests for an application that you are already working on which turned out to be really difficult. So on this project ill be starting out with a small test project
### Cycle
1. Write a test, and watch it fail.
2. Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor.
4. Repeat.
## <b>Prerequisites</b>
